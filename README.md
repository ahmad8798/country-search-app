## Components

### CountryCard

Displays information about a single country, including its flag, name, population, region, and capital.

**Props:**

- `country` (object): The country data to display. This object should have the following properties:

- `name` (object): Contains a `common` property with the country's name.

- `region` (string): The region to which the country belongs.

- `population` (number): The population of the country.

- `capital` (array): An array containing the capital city of the country.

- `flags` (object): Contains a `png` property with the URL of the country's flag image.

```jsx
<CountryCard
  country={{
    name: { common: "Germany" },

    region: "Europe",

    population: 83783942,

    capital: ["Berlin"],

    flags: { png: "https://flagcdn.com/w320/de.png" },
  }}
/>
```

**Description:**

- The `CountryCard` component takes a `country` object and displays its flag, name, population, region, and capital in a styled card format.

- The `isDarkModeEnabled` prop adjusts the cardâ€™s styling to match the current theme (dark or light).

### CardList

A container component that wraps a list of country cards in a responsive grid.

**Props:**

- `children` (ReactNode): The country cards to be displayed.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<CardList>
  {countries.map((country) => (
    <CountryCard key={country.cca3} country={country} />
  ))}
</CardList>
```

**Description:**

- The `CardList` component arranges its children (typically `CountryCard` components) in a responsive grid using Bootstrap's `Container` and `Row` components.

### Header

Displays the application title and includes a toggle button for dark mode.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Header isDarkModeEnabled={isDarkModeEnabled} toggleDarkMode={toggleDarkMode} />
```

**Description:**

- The `Header` component displays the title of the application and a button to toggle dark mode on or off.

### RegionsDropDownButton

A dropdown button for selecting regions to filter countries.

**Props:**

- `regions` (array): List of regions to display in the dropdown.

- `handleRegionChange` (function): Function to handle region selection.

- `selectedRegion` (string): The currently selected region.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<RegionsDropDownButton
  regions={["Europe", "Asia", "Africa"]}
  handleRegionChange={handleRegionChange}
  selectedRegion={selectedRegion}
/>
```

**Description:**

- The `RegionsDropDownButton` component provides a dropdown menu for selecting a region.

- It updates the selected region via the `handleRegionChange` function and adjusts its styling based on the `isDarkModeEnabled` prop.

### SearchBar

A search bar for filtering countries by name.

**Props:**

- `handleSearchChange` (function): Function to handle search input changes.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<SearchBar handleSearchChange={handleSearchChange} />
```

**Description:**

- The `SearchBar` component allows users to enter a search term to filter the list of countries.

- The `handleSearchChange` function updates the search term.

### SearchFilterBar

A container for the search bar and region filter dropdown, arranged in a flexible layout.

**Props:**

- `children` (ReactNode): The search bar and dropdown components.

- `className` (string): Additional CSS classes to apply.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<SearchFilterBar className="mt-5">
  <SearchBar handleSearchChange={handleSearchChange} />

  <RegionsDropDownButton
    regions={regions}
    handleRegionChange={handleRegionChange}
    selectedRegion={selectedRegion}
  />
</SearchFilterBar>
```

**Description:**

- The `SearchFilterBar` component arranges its children (search bar and dropdown) in a responsive and flexible layout using Bootstrap's `Container` and `d-flex` classes.

### SkeletonCard

A loading skeleton Card component that provides a placeholder while data is being fetched.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<SkeletonCard />
```

**Description:**

- The `SkeletonCard` component displays a placeholder card that mimics the layout of `CountryCard` components.

- It is used to maintain layout consistency while the actual country data is being fetched.

### SkeletonCardList

A utility component that renders a list of skeleton placeholders while the actual data is being fetched.

**Props:**

- `count` (number): The number of skeleton cards to render.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<SkeletonCardList count={8} />
```

**Description:**

- The `SkeletonCardList` component is designed to display a specified number of skeleton placeholders by using the `SkeletonCard` component. It arranges these placeholders in a responsive grid layout, just like the `CardList` component.

- This component is particularly useful for maintaining layout consistency during data loading, providing a smooth user experience.

## Pages

### Home

The main page of the application that fetches country data, manages dark mode, and provides search and filter functionality.

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Home />
```

**Description:**

- The `Home` page is responsible for fetching data from the REST Countries API, managing dark mode, and filtering countries based on search input and selected region.

- It uses the `useFetch` hook to retrieve data and the `useFilteredCountries` hook to apply filters.
